         Harvey Dale
       </h3>
       <h4>
         After growing up in San Antonio as an only child surrounded by family members whom of which were rock lovers, Dale moved to the music capital to pursue a career as a musician. With only $15 in his pocket and a guitar case in hand, he set off with a mission to form the greatest rock band of all time. The goal was at least five members, and although he was unable to achieve that goal, the dream remained alive. After living in a shitty $1000/month apartment and spending months putting up flyers all over the 512, he found his future bandmates, Tyler and Austin.

         Tyler Funke
       </h3>
       <h4>
         The Austinite never grew up around music. His uptight family home was filled with crosses and catholics with no regard for any genre other than what the gospel choir sang every Sunday. Everything changed for Funke when he attended The University of Texas at Austin and joined Afterglow, an online music publication. He joined because it was the only magazine that sparked his imagination and drive. Once he joined, he was introduced to a variety of artists, bands, and genres.

         Austin Stone
       </h3>

       <h4>
         Stone moved from Colorado to Texas after attending his first Austin City Limits music festival. It was the most eye-opening experience of his life, plus he loved the food. So, he moved. Packed up everything he owned, kissed his parents goodbye, and set off to Austin, Texas. In his freetime, he studies the lyrics of his favorite songs daily. There was no rest for this guy. When he arrived, he was pumping gas and looked up to find a flyer, "Bandmates Wanted," with writing that looked like it belonged to a seven-year-old. Although it seemed risky, he gave the number a call and the rest was history.
